      <title>Diversity With Tidycensus</title>

      <description>There are very few recent packages that I can say shaved a month off of my dissertation work, particularly in a language like R where there are 3,000,000 ways to do the same thing. But tidycensus, my hat&amp;rsquo;s off to you üëèüëèüëè! If you need Census data (or not) I strongly urge you to check out Kyle Walker&amp;rsquo;s tidycnesus.
Diversity is a difficult concept. It might be even more difficult to assess simply because there are several ways to measure it.</description>

      <description>This was one of those moments where my Googling ability failed me. For learning purposes, this is great, but in terms of time, well I&amp;rsquo;m never getting those couple of days in February back. So this is a story about how I thought I solved a problem that had yet to be solved. This is also a story about how I was stupid to think that I was the first to solve a problem that must be fairly common.</description>

      <description>Confession 1: I&amp;rsquo;m less of a person this week. I had my appendix removed on Tuesday. It was my first surgical experience where I was anesthetized, which scared the hell out of me. Turns out that the doctor tells you to take some breaths and the next thing you know you are being woken up by a man named Nate who should really be more interested in your inebriated, albeit transcendental, commentary.</description>

      <title>Coin Flip Probability with Go</title>

      <description>I decided to return to this problem of average probability of getting two heads flipped in a row versus a heads then a tails. I know, beat a dead horse much (üíÄüê¥)? Hear me out&amp;hellip;
Sadly, our 100 year old oak in the front yard is slowly dying, which means that for the majority of the day today, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have electricity&amp;hellip;and electricity causes internet, which means that I also didn&amp;rsquo;t have internet.</description>

      <description>I created something new. Actually, I am creating something new and I am proud to say that I finally got to name something after my favorite cephalopod, the humble cuttlefish. Don&amp;rsquo;t know what a cuttlefish is?
here&amp;rsquo;s one

&amp;hellip;and here&amp;rsquo;s another

They&amp;rsquo;re basically chameleon squids but more chameleon than a chameleon and more squid than a squid and they obviously can do things with color that hummingbirds do with flight.</description>

      <title>Coin Flip Probability with Python</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing up my dissertation&amp;hellip;but occasionally I need a distraction. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I find studying hate speech very fascinating, but in all honesty, it gets to be a bit much sometimes. The world can be a depressing place. Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s a dissertation; distractions are welcome in any flavor.
Today my distraction came in the form of a Tweet by David Robinson demonstrating how flipping a coin and getting a heads and then another heads takes 6 flips on average while a heads then a tails only takes 4.</description>
