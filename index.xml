      <description>There are very few recent packages that I can say shaved a month off of my dissertation work, particularly in a language like R where there are 3,000,000 ways to do the same thing. But tidycensus, my hat&amp;rsquo;s off to you üëèüëèüëè! If you need Census data (or not) I strongly urge you to check out Kyle Walker&amp;rsquo;s tidycnesus.
